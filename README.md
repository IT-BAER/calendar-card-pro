## üéØ Overview

### About

Calendar Card Pro was inspired by a beautiful [calendar design using button-card and Hass calendar add-on](https://community.home-assistant.io/t/calendar-add-on-some-calendar-designs/385790) shared in the Home Assistant community. While the original design was visually stunning, implementing it with button-card led to performance issues. This motivated me to create a dedicated card focused on doing one thing exceptionally well: displaying your upcoming events beautifully and efficiently.

Built with performance in mind, the card uses intelligent refresh mechanisms and smart caching to ensure smooth operation even with multiple calendars.

### Features

- üé® Multiple calendars with individual styling
- üìä Smart compact mode with expand/collapse functionality
- üîÑ Smart update system with automatic refresh and state detection
- ‚ö° Optimized performance with user-configurable smart caching
- üéØ Progressive loading for smooth rendering
- üì± Responsive and touch-friendly design
- üåç Multi-language support (en/de)
- üìç Customizable location display
- üïí Flexible time format options (12/24 hour)
- üé® Extensive styling options
- üîç Modular architecture for better maintainability

### Dependencies

This card requires one or more calendar entities in Home Assistant. It works with any calendar integration that creates calendar.\* entities, with CalDAV and Google Calendar being the primary tested integrations.

‚ö†Ô∏è **Important**: Make sure you have at least one calendar integration set up in Home Assistant before using this card.

### Advanced Features

#### Entity Configuration

The `entities` array accepts either strings (entity IDs) or objects with extended configuration:

- A string (entity ID only)
- An object with the following properties:
  - `entity`: Calendar entity ID (required)
  - `color`: Custom color for event titles from this calendar (optional), overwrites event_color when set

#### Event Display & Compact Mode

##### Default Behavior

By default, the card displays all events for the next 3 days (including today), regardless of the number of events. This means:

- If there are no events in the next 3 days, the card will show an empty state
- If there are many events, all of them will be shown, potentially making the card quite tall
- The card's height adapts dynamically to the content
- By default, events that have ended today are hidden, but you can set `show_past_events: true` to keep displaying them

This flexible height works well for many dashboard layouts but might not be ideal for all use cases, particularly on wall-mounted tablets or dashboards with fixed-height cards.

##### Compact Mode

To better control the card's size, you can enable compact mode by setting the `max_events_to_show` option. This creates a sliding window of events that:

- Shows up to the specified number of events within the configured time range
- Maintains a consistent card height
- Automatically updates as events pass

The card supports toggling between compact and full views by tapping/clicking (default behavior) or through custom tap/hold actions. This provides easy access to all events while maintaining a clean, space-efficient display by default.

#### Actions

Both `tap_action` and `hold_action` support the following options:

- `action`: The type of action
  - `expand`: Toggle between compact and full view (when max_events_to_show is set)
  - `more-info`: Show more information about the entity
  - `navigate`: Navigate to a different view
  - `call-service`: Call a Home Assistant service
  - `url`: Open a URL
- `navigation_path`: Path for navigate action
- `url_path`: URL for url action
- `service`: Service to call (for call-service action)
- `service_data`: Service data (for call-service action)

#### Auto-Refresh and Update Behavior

Calendar Card Pro uses a sophisticated approach to keep calendar data current while minimizing API calls:

- **Automatic Refresh**: The card proactively fetches new data every `refresh_interval` minutes (default: 30) even without user interaction
- **Smart Caching**: Events are stored locally and considered valid for `cache_duration` minutes (default: 30) so repeated views don't trigger unnecessary API calls
- **Reactive Updates**: Besides the timed refresh, events are also updated when:
  - You return to a browser tab after being away for 5+ minutes
  - A calendar entity's state changes in Home Assistant
  - The card configuration changes
  - The Home Assistant connection is restored after being disconnected

This approach ensures your calendar stays current while maintaining excellent performance and responsiveness.
