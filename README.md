## About

Calendar Card Pro was inspired by a beautiful [calendar design using button-card and Hass calendar add-on](https://community.home-assistant.io/t/calendar-add-on-some-calendar-designs/385790) shared in the Home Assistant community. While I loved the clean aesthetic of that design, I found that implementing it with button-card and card-mod led to performance issues. This motivated me to create a dedicated custom card that would:

- Maintain the sleek, minimalist design I admired
- Optimize performance through native implementation
- Provide extensive customization options
- Work directly with Home Assistant's calendar integrations like CalDAV
- Remove dependencies on external add-ons

The result is Calendar Card Pro - a performant, customizable calendar card focused on doing one thing well: displaying your calendar events beautifully.

# To-Do: Incorporate the main purpose of this card in the section above => Goal is to provide a quick overview/glance of upcoming events in the calendar, ideal for use on a dashboard like on a smart home wall tablet.

## Dependencies

This card requires one or more calendar entities in Home Assistant. While it should work with any calendar integration that creates *calendar.** entities in Home Assistant, I tested it only with CalDAV as well as Google Calendar integration. For the best experience, follow the [CalDAV setup instructions](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/caldav/) in the official Home Assistant documentation to get started.

‚ö†Ô∏è **Important**: Make sure you have at least one calendar integration set up in Home Assistant before using this card.

### Entity Configuration

Each entity in the `entities` array can be either:
- A string (entity ID only)
- An object with the following properties:
  - `entity`: Calendar entity ID (required)
  - `color`: Custom color for events from this calendar (optional)

### Actions

# TODO: Convert this section from a flat list into an array of options, or refer to standard HA documentation for available options in case they my card does 100% support all standard HA actions

Both `tap_action` and `hold_action` support the following options:
- `action`: The type of action (more-info, navigate, call-service, url)
- `navigation_path`: Path for navigate action
- `url_path`: URL for url action
- `service`: Service to call (for call-service action)
- `service_data`: Service data (for call-service action)

### Update Interval

The card primarily relies on real-time updates through Home Assistant's WebSocket connection and dashboard refreshes. The `update_interval` (12 hours) is only used as a fallback cache duration to prevent unnecessary API calls. It is not recommended to set a shorter interval as this could lead to excessive API calls without providing any benefits, since real-time updates are already handled through WebSocket. In normal operation, you'll see updates immediately as they happen in your calendars.
